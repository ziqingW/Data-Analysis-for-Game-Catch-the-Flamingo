# Data Analysis for Game: Catch the Flamingo
**Introduction**  
The Capstone Project for Big Data Specialization in Coursera.  

In this culminating project, I built a big data ecosystem using machine learning and data analysis tools to analyze the data set simulating big data generated from a large number of users who are playing an imaginary game "Catch the Pink Flamingo". The final results were reported as slides to the imaginary high-level officers of the game developer company. Several solutions were recommended as to increase game revenue.  

The whole report includes a series of steps as data acquiring, exploring, preparing, analyzing, and reporting. 

Major techniques and softwares used in this project:
* **Splunk** for data previewing and exploring   
* **KNIME** for Decision Tree classification model  
* **Spark ML** for Clustering model  
* **Neo4j** for relationship analysis and visualization  

**Data**  
There are two major parts of data:  
1. Game related data,  
2. Conversation data between users or teams.  

The detailed explanation of each file and every step of data processing and analyzing can be found in the file of *Technical_appendix.pdf*.  

**Report**  
The full report can be seen in the file *Final_report.pdf*.
